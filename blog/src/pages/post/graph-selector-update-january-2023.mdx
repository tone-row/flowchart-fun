> **TL;DR** – There's a new syntax. It's opt-in. It's great. [Try it out– click here!](https://flowchart.fun/n#MIewdgLghglmCmAnABAbwFDOQFQBYwGdkoAHE5AdxEQGsiAjAT2QkZLgHNMtkBJMACbxInZAGNE8KBHhEoyADZwaLEC1zxxAV0STIiuPG5YoYZjIAeEAFzJ68AGbVN8sSAXhxk6bOKKo9groAL7cwN4yfkpgKgIwkmIQCsxaBKIQGsjwFlCJ-oEs2RDGBjSaGYS2ABR4hMRklNR0duZsnACUJdTIAMQwAiVYTMQCcWAcxGDIADp9ApPzkg5IwmLpuNKDPEpl6pXIVXPtyAD0J8gAmiBa4qbECgRqqZpp4wrwALTRmm4Atr-CCAEdAnABU6Go6F+WgUEBg33QfwBkGB6AAElAAG6aBxaMAAQmQgB4NwCR++hQSd0OgALy02noDBYABEJCgiAISCZtiZHEQpFwHw570S1CZIRpdOpQA)

[Graph Selector](https://graph-selector-syntax.tone-row.com/) - our open-source syntax & parser that we have been working on since August - is now ready for consumption for users of Flowchart Fun!

## Why a new syntax?

The new syntax is more expressive, makes more features possible, and is (we hope) more intuitive because it borrows from CSS selectors [(read the original post about that)](https://flowchart.fun/blog/post/graph-syntax-css-selector).

It also patches some confusing design choices of the last syntax (see _references_ below)

## Spare the Deets! Gimme the Feats!

Here are some of the things that are already possible with the new syntax:

### Containers

It allows for containers to be created, which makes it easier to organise your charts.

### Classes

It makes relationship mapping more expressive by allowing pointers to (and from!) classes.

### References

It removes ambiguity by allowing you to create an edge from a reference, when a reference is on the line above.

### Edge Data

You can now store data (ID's, classes, attributes) on edges too. This is a big win for the expressivity of the language because it's possible to store things like weights on edges. That syntax looks like:

```
Node A
  [weight=5] edge label: Node B
  [weight=10] edge label: Node C
```

For an example of how this can be used, check out the [Sankey Diagram Example](https://graph-selector-syntax.tone-row.com/sankey#sankey-diagram) on the Graph Selector site.

### Easier Escaping

It's now possible to escape characters in the syntax by using a backslash. This means that you can use the following characters in your labels without having to resort to URI encoding.

## Some Differences

There are a few things which work differently in the new syntax, but we think they're for the better.

1. Multiple pointers can no longer be on the same line. This was done to make parsing easier, but also to encourage classes as a better means for creating multiple edges per line.
1. Node Data has been moved to the other side of the node label to keep edge labels and node labels adjacent. This was done for easier document scanning.<br/>**Before** `[id] Node`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**After** `Node #id`
1. Colons now need to be followed by a space to create an edge label or add edge data.<br/>**Before** `edge:Node`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**After** `edge: Node`
1. Linking by ID now requires the # in the reference.<br/>**Before** `(someId)`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**After** `(#someId)`

## How to Use It

The new syntax is opt-in, but it would be great if you could make the switch.

To enable it on your flowchart click to the Layout tab and choose "graph-selector" from the parsers dropdown.

Alternatively you can create a fresh flowchart using this template: [GRAPH SELECTOR STARTER](https://flowchart.fun/n#MIewdgLghglmCmAnABAbwFDOQFQBYwGdkoAHE5AdxEQGsiAjAT2QkZLgHNMtkBJMACbxInZAGNE8KBHhEoyADZwaLEC1zxxAV0STIiuPG5YoYZjIAeEAFzJ68AGbVN8sSAXhxk6bOKKo9groAL7cwN4yfkpgKgIwkmIQCsxaBKIQGsjwFlCJ-oEs2RDGBjSaGYS2ABR4hMRklNR0duZsnACUJdTIAMQwAiVYTMQCcWAcxGDIADp9ApPzkg5IwmLpuNKDPEpl6pXIVXPtyAD0J8gAmiBa4qbECgRqqZpp4wrwALTRmm4Atr-CCAEdAnABU6Go6F+WgUEBg33QfwBkGB6AAElAAG6aBxaMAAQmQgB4NwCR++hQSd0OgALy02noDBYABEJCgiAISCZtiZHEQpFwHw570S1CZIRpdOpQA)

## Next Steps for the Parser

The next milestone we’re aiming to reach is the ability to add images and LaTeX– one of the most requested features– to flowcharts. In a month or two we’ll be transitioning completely to graph-selector with an opt-out strategy.

## That's the Plan

We’d love to hear your thoughts, so why not try it out and let us know? We’re on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/tone_row_), and we’re also considering starting a Flowchart Fun Discord 🤔
