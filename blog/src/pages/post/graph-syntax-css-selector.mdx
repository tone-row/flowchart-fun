> **TL;DR** This is an article about stumbling into an interesting syntax for describing graphs. If you want to see it in action you can [head straight for the demos!](http://graph-selector-syntax.vercel.app/)

## Some Context

About 18 months ago I created [Flowchart Fun](https://flowchart.fun): an app for generating flowcharts from text.

To create your flowchart, the app determines the nodes and edges from the input text according to a set of rules:

- text creates a node
- an indent creates an edge
- text before a colon `:` labels an edge

```plaintext
Node A
  edge to: Node B
```

  width="443"
  alt="Flowchart Node A edge to Node B"
/>

Simple! Elegant! Chic!

But as with all things, over time some complexity crept in.

## #1 - Too Many Parents

As long as nodes have zero or one parent, creating edges with indentation works great, e.g. a tree ðŸŒ³ or document outline; however, pretty often flowcharts contain at least one node with multiple parents.

<img

  alt="Cake flowchart"
/>

In our syntax a node only "lives" on one line, so we added the pointer syntax `()` to reference nodes elsewhere in the document.

```plaintext
Are you hungry?
  yes: Do you want to eat healthy?
    yes: No you don't
      oh right: CAKE!
    hell no: (CAKE!)
  no: yes you are
    (CAKE!)
```

## #2 - Long Labels

When the label is short, like `CAKE!`, creating pointers is as easy as... pie, but what about when the label is a college essay?

<img

  width="443"
  alt="Extremely long label for flowchart node"
/>

Typing long labels twice (once for the node and once for the pointer) would be time consuming and clutter the document- not to mention the label could change and cause the pointer to break. ðŸ˜•

To solve this problem we use the concept of ID's. We can give our node an ID `[a]` and reference the ID in the pointer `(a)`. Crisis averted!

```plaintext
[a] This is an extraordinarily long label that will flow onto many lines and ultimately cause a lot of heartache for this otherwise simple graph.
  b
    (a)
```

## #3 - Adding Styles

[Flowchart Fun](https://flowchart.fun) is built using [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) which uses the concept of CSS selectors to style nodes and edges.

As a frontend developer, I love this solution. After all, the DOM is a tree of nodes too.

  width="350"
  alt="If it's good enough for the DOM it's good enough for me!"
/>

To add colors and shapes, I brought Cytoscape's concept of classes into the syntax.

```plaintext
[a.blue] This is an extraordinarily long label that will flow onto many lines and ultimately cause a lot of heartache for this otherwise simple graph.
  [.star.yellow] b
    (a)
```

## Not bad&hellip; could it be better?

This is how Flowchart Fun works today, but Iâ€™ve always felt it missed the opportunity of piggy-backing on a more well-known syntax: CSS Selectors.

Many people are familiar with `#` representing idâ€™s, `.` representing classes, and being able to string them together to refer to specific elements in the DOM. Consider this alternative:

```plaintext
#a.blue This is an extraordinarily long label that will flow onto many lines and ultimately cause a lot of heartache for this otherwise simple graph.
  .star.yellow b
    (#a)
```

With that, we have something that looks a little more familiar! For my frontends, it may even remind you of [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) or [Jade](https://github.com/dscape/jade). The familiarity is already a win, but after staring at this revised syntax for a bit something else clicked.

## Storytime

Once upon a time, someone wrote to me asking how they could use the syntax to create Bayesian Decision Trees. Naturally, being a very intelligent smart person, I immediately knew what they were talking about- but in case you do not, some internet searching reveals that it's something like this:

<img
  src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LP10c.jpg"
  alt="bayesian decision tree"
  width="443"
/>

The idea is that each edge stores a probability. Then, the probability of arriving at a node can be determined by walking up the tree and multiplying the edges on the way.

I built a crude version of this idea and eventually moved on, but one thing always stuck with me- **being able to associate arbitrary data to nodes and edges would be really powerful.** ðŸª„

## ðŸ’¡

I eventually had the galaxy brain moment. CSS Selectors. Specifically, the attribute syntax for CSS selectors (i.e., `[key=value]`) is a known way to target- or in our case express- auxiliary data about a node.

```plaintext
#id.class1.class2[key=value][key2=value2] Node Label
```

Now, in addition to capturing the relationship between data points (nodes, edges) we can also store information about our data points; effectively storing tabular data. _Look ma, I'm a CSV!_

```plaintext
[population=12396372] SÃ£o Paulo
[population=6775561] Rio de Janeiro
[population=3094325] Distrito Federal
[population=2900319] Bahia
[population=2703391] CearÃ¡
```

  width="443"
  alt="but wait, there's more"
/>

Taking it a step further, rather than just being descriptors, we could turn around and use our selectors the way HÃ¥kon Wium Lie (the myth, the legend, the inventor of CSS) originally intended: to **target** a set of nodes in our graph. For example:

```plaintext
.color red
.color blue
.color yellow

// create edges from node 'paintbrush' to 'red', 'blue', and 'yellow'
// with the label 'paints'
paintbrush
	paints: (.color)
```

  alt="Paintbrush Flowchart"
/>

## _Okay, and...?_

If you've read this far, then you're either great at procrastinating or you have the same burning passion for quirky domain-specific languages as I do. Either way, I promise I'm at the point.

This is what I think is cool about thisâ€” instead of just describing a flowchart, this syntax can be used to describe a ton of different types of data visualizations. It can be used to produce [bar charts](https://graph-selector-syntax.vercel.app/bar-graph), [area charts](https://graph-selector-syntax.vercel.app/tabular-data), or even [Sankey diagrams](https://graph-selector-syntax.vercel.app/sankey).

  alt="Sankey Diagram"
/>

We can even use the same document to produce multiple types of graphs to illustrate different properties of the data. Wowowow!

## A CSS-Inspired Syntax for Flowcharts?

Sure, why not! This is what I've done so far:

- created a [website of examples](https://graph-selector-syntax.vercel.app/)
- created a [repository](https://github.com/tone-row/graph-selector-syntax) with a parser

## What do you think? ðŸ‘€

I'm really interested in getting some feedback, especially for these questions:

- What could people see this being used for?<br/>What other examples should I add to the site?
- I named the repo **Graph Selector Syntax**, but that's not very fun. Can anyone suggest a name?
- Should I migrate [Flowchart Fun](https://flowchart.fun) to this syntax?
