## A blog? Where?

[Flowchart Fun](https://flowchart.fun) is my first public project and product.

My background in software development has really helped me learn to&hellip; develop software

![no cap](https://media0.giphy.com/media/VinEXyAS1EI1LUZdjl/200w.webp?cid=ecf05e47hfweena8xwih6u0lgl9pifxmyvy5p2m1j0enjgvv&rid=200w.webp&ct=s)

&hellip;but it hasn't helped me learn when and how to communicate with users.

It didn't teach me to aggregate conversations across Twitter messages, Github issues, and Hacker News discussions into actionable steps forward. It definitely didn't teach me how to write a blog post.

All of those things are new to me, and I'm learning as I go.

## A blog? Why?

Flowchart Fun is an actively maintained piece of software. I work on it every week. I'm constantly adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving the user experience.

Unfortunately, much of that process is invisible. I don't have a public roadmap nor a public changelog. I don't even tweet religiously.

No more!

## Bienvenue, blog!

Expect this blog to be context-bound to Flowchart Fun. I'll focus on things like:

- changes to the product and the rationale behind them
- updates to the [syntax](https://github.com/tone-row/graph-selector-syntax)
- gauging interest in new features
- building plugins for Obsidian, Logseq, Roam, and other PKMS's

The [changelog](/changelog) syncs with Github releases, and the [roadmap](/roadmap) is watching my Linear issues so both pages will always be up-to-date.

Time for some building in public!
